This is a small node.js/websockets project aimed at establishing a framework for people to create keystroke mapped button panels on tablets, phones, and other touch screen mobile thingies.

##Quick and dirty Usage:

1. Install node.js if you don't have it
2. Edit the json file appconfig.js to point your copy of keybanger.exe (for now you need to be running windows and have .net installed.. sorry)
3. run 'node app.js' in the root directory.  
4. Fire up a browser on your iThang to: http://yournodeserverip:webserverportinappconfig.js

The rest is up to you to hack.
